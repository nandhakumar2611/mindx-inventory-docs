Custom Status
In Zoho Books, a sales order can have a standard set of statuses like Draft, Open, Void and Closed. However, you can add a status of your own. When you do so, you need to select a ‘parent’ status from the set of default statuses present in Zoho Books.

Whenever the sales order is in the parent status, you can changes it to your custom status.

For example, let’s say you create a custom status named To be shipped with the parent status being Open. Now, a sales order in the Open status can be marked as To be shipped.

To create a custom status in Zoho Books:

Go to Settings on the top right corner of the page.
Select Sales Orders under Sales.
Switch to the Custom Status tab.
Click + New Custom Status.
Choose the parent status and enter the name of your custom status.
Click Save.

Click More to view and mark the custom status.
