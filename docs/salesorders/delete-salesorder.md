Delete Sales Order
You can delete the sales order you have sent to your customer. Hereâ€™s how:

- Go to **Sales** on the left sidebar and select **Sales Orders**.
- Locate the sales orders you wish to delete from the list.
- Select the **checkbox** next to the sales orders you want to mark for deletion.
- Click the **Delete** button at the right side of the page.

Please **note** that if you have already **invoiced** the sales order, you will not be able to delete it directly. To proceed with deleting the sales order, you must first delete the associated invoice.
