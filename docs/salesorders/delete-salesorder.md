Delete Sales Order
You can delete the sales order you have sent to your customer. Hereâ€™s how:

Go to Sales > Sales Orders.
Select the sales order you want to delete.
Click More > Delete.
Delete Purchase Order

If you have already invoiced the sales order, you will not be able to delete it. You will have to first delete the invoice before deleting the sales order.
