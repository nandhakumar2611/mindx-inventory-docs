Introduction - Sales Order
A Sales Order is a document sent to your customers confirming the items and prices of a sale. A sales order is usually created after a quote is accepted by your customers and your items are ready to be shipped or delivered to your customers.

The workflow of a sales order in Zoho Books is as follows:

Create a sales order which details the items that you are going to sell to your customers and their prices. Save it as a Draft.
Once the sales order is confirmed, convert it to Open.
Convert the sales order into an Invoice and send it to your customer.
If you have low stock of your items, you can convert your sales order to a Purchase Order.

Sales Order from Quote
Do you want to convert a quote to a sales order? In Zoho Books, you have the option to convert a quote which is in the Accepted status directly to a sales order.

When is this useful?
Let’s say you have created a quote for your customer. Once your customer accepts the quote, you might want to convert it into a sales order confirming the items to be sold, the delivery method and other necessary details.

To convert a quote into sales order:

Go to Sales > Quotes.
Select the quote which you want to convert into a sales order.
Click Convert and select Convert to Sales Order from the dropdown.
The New Sales Order page will be auto-populated. Verify the details, and save and send it to your customer.
