Customer Credit Limit
As a business owner, you might sell your goods/services on credit to your customers. This in turn, increases the risk of having huge amounts of overdue balance by customers. Zoho Books now lets you set a credit limit for each customer, thereby letting you have control over the outstanding receivable balances. So, apart from just sending payment reminders for overdue invoices, enabling this will help you to avoid many outstanding invoices.

You will also be able to view the customer’s credit limit in the Customer Balances Report.

Prerequisite: Credit limits can be set only in the organisation’s base currency even if a foreign currency has been associated to the customer.
