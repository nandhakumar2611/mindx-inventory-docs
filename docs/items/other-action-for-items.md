Delete Item
If you are no longer using an item in your organization, you might want to delete it. However, if you have recorded any sales or purchase transactions for that item, you would need to delete them first.

A better alternative would be to mark the item as inactive. When you do so, they will no longer appear in your transactions. If you want to start using that item again, you can mark it as active.

To view the sales transactions:

Go to Reports > Sales by Item.
To view the purchase transactions:

Go to Reports > Purchases by Item.
You have to delete all these transactions of the item in order to delete the item.

After you’ve deleted all the transactions, you can delete the item. Here’s how:

Go to the Items module and select Items.
Select the item you wish to delete.
Click More > Delete.
Click Delete to confirm.
