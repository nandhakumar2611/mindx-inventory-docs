FIFO Cost Lot Tracking
This report tracks batches of items which you buy from your vendors and sell to your customer.

The number of items in each batch is displayed below the Quantity under Product In.

Zoho Books works on the First In First Out (FIFO) stock tracking principle. So, any sales made will result in deduction of stock from the oldest purchases made for that item. As stock of each purchase transactions gets over, the stock gets deducted from the subsequent purchase transactions. This report gives you a detailed summary of quantity of items purchased and items sold multiple times at multiple rates.

With this report, you can see the transactions from your vendors in the Product In section and the sales to your customers from the same batch in the Product Out section.

This helps you to track the profit or loss incurred while selling of items batch wise.
