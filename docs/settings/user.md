Who Is a User?
A user is someone who has access to your Zoho Books organization. An organization in Zoho Books can have multiple users.

Add User
When you create a Zoho Books account, you become the default admin of your organization. Once you are an admin, you can add multiple users with different roles to your organization. Here’s how you can do it:

Go to Settings in the top right corner of the page.
Select Users under Users & Roles.
Click Invite User on the top right corner of the page.
Enter the email address, name and the role of the user you’re going to invite to your organization.
Click Save.
After doing so, an email will be sent to the new user, from where they have to verify the link and set up a login password to access your Zoho Books organization.

Note: Only users with Admin access can add new users.

Enter the Label Name, select a Data Type for it, and fill in the other required details.
If the field that you’re going to add is a Personally Identifiable Information (PII), mark it as such under Is this PII?
Click Save.
Custom Fields
This new field will be saved under the Field Customization tab. You can perform different actions on it by hovering over the field and clicking the Edit or drop-down arrow next to it.

Custom Field Actions
The custom field(s) that you create under Field Customization will be shown while adding a new user to your organization.
