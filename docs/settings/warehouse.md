# **Warehouses**

In MindX Inventory, warehouses represent physical stock locations where inventory is stored. You can manage multiple warehouses to streamline sales, purchases, and inventory transfers. When creating orders, select the warehouse from or to which you want to dispatch or receive stock.

## **Add New Warehouse**

To add a new warehouse to your organization:
