MSME Settings
On October 2, 2006, the Government of India introduced the concept of Micro, Small, and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs) through the Micro, Small, and Medium Enterprises Development (MSMED) Act, 2006 aiming to promote the growth of MSMEs in India. This provides benefits to businesses based on their size, investment in machinery or equipment, and revenue.

To ensure MSME businesses get paid on time, the Government of India has added a new clause, clause (h), in section 43B of the Income Tax Act of the Finance Act 2023. This clause states that if you make a purchase from an MSME-registered business and make a payment for that purchase within 45 days from the date of purchase, the purchase amount will be allowed as a deduction on an accrual basis (as of the bill date). However, if you make the payment after 45 days of the purchase, the purchase amount will still be allowed as a deduction on a cash basis (as of the payment date). If the payment date falls in the next financial year while the bill is in the current financial year, this will increase your tax liability for the current financial year.

In Zoho Books, if your organisation is registered as an MSME, you can add its MSME details. You can also enter the MSME/Udyam registration number in your organisation’s address to stay compliant with section 43B(h) of the Finance Act 2023. Furthermore, you can add the MSME details of your vendors to view your unpaid bills to your MSME vendors.
