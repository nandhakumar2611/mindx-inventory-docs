Cash Flow
In Zoho Books, the Cash Flow component shows the cash flowing in and out of your organisation. The Cash Flow Graph is generated based on your organisation’s cash flow report. This graph is shown based on the following three sections:

Cash as on “Date”: This displays the cash you had at the beginning and the end of your fiscal year.
Incoming: The sum of debit entries from banks, cards, cash, and payment clearing accounts.
Outgoing: The sum of credit entries from banks, cards, cash, and payment clearing accounts.
Insight:The graph is made using the direct method, where you can calculate the difference between the total cash spent and the total cash received by your organisation. The cash flow statement report uses the indirect method, which includes non-cash expenses like depreciation and inventory adjustments. For instance, you can calculate the difference between the net income and a purchase you haven’t paid for.
