Bill Of Entry
The Bill of Entry lets you record custom duty and other charges involved with the import of goods from vendors outside India, or from Special Economic Zones (SEZs).

A bill of entry can be created for a bill which is in the Open status.

The Bill of Entry will reflect on your GSTR-3B and GSTR-2. This will update the GSTN with custom duty and other charges that you had incurred during the import of your goods.

Note: The Bill of Entry can be generated only for Vendors who are in SEZs or overseas.

Landed Costs
The Landed Cost of a product is the cost incurred while bringing a product that you have purchased from your vendor into your warehouse. This cost is exclusive of the cost of goods. Few examples of landed costs include freight, shipping charges, customs and other charges that the seller may incur till they procures the goods.

Tracking the landed costs help you calculate the actual cost in receiving the product(s). This, in turn, will help you to decide the selling price for your stock without compromising your profits.

Note: This feature is available only for certain plans of Zoho Books. Visit the pricing page to check if it’s available in your current plan.

Enable Landed Costs
To enable landed costs in Zoho Books:

Go to Settings on the top right corner of the page.
Select Items under Items.
Check the Track landed cost on items option.
Click Save.
Enable Landed Costs
Note: You will be able to enable landed costs only if you have enabled inventory tracking for your organization. If you haven’t enabled it yet, check the I would like to enable Inventory option in the same page (Settings > Items > Items).

Allocate Landed Costs
Once you have enabled landed costs for your organization, you will be able to add and allocate them to the items in your bills.

Allocating Landed Costs from One Bill to Another
There may be cases where your vendor does not offer any shipping for the product and you get it shipped by another shipping agency.

Select the bill to which you want to allocate the landed cost(s).
