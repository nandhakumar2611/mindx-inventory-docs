# Convert to Sales Order

Once the customer accepts the quote or you mark it as accepted, you can convert the quote into a sales order. Here’s how:

Go to Sales on the left sidebar, and select Quotes.
Select the quote that you want to convert to a sales order.
In the Details page, click Convert and select Convert to Sales Order in the dropdown.
You’ll be redirected to the New Sales Order page, review the details, and update any details if needed.
Click Save as Draft to save it as a draft, or Save and Send to save and send it to the customer.
Now, once you convert the quote into a sales order, you can either send it to the customer directly or mark it as confirmed if you’ve shared it through other means and received confirmation.
