Quotes
A quote is a proposal you send to customers that lists the items you plan to sell, their prices, and the terms of the sale. In Zoho Books, you can create quotes and send quotes to your customers. Once a customer accepts a quote, you can quickly convert it into a sales order or an invoice. You can also perform additional actions, such as creating a retainer invoice or a project from the quote.

How Quotes Work
Once you create a quote in Zoho Books, you can send it to your customer. If you’ve shared the quote through other means, you can manually mark it as sent. Once the customer accepts the quote, it is marked as accepted. If the customer accepts the quote through other means, you can manually mark it as accepted. After that, you can convert the accepted quote into a sales order or invoice when you’re ready to deliver the product or service to the customer.

Create a Quote
Log in to your Zoho Books account.
Go to Sales on the left sidebar, and select Quotes.
Click + New in the top right corner.
In the New Quote page, fill in the following fields:
Customer Name: Select the customer for whom you want to create the quote from the dropdown.
Quote#: The quote number will auto-populate, but you can click the Settings icon and choose the option to enter a custom quote number, if needed.
Reference#: Enter a reference number, if necessary.
Quote Date: By default, the current date is selected when you create the quote. You can modify the date while creating the quote.
Expiry Date: Select the date until which the quote is valid. The customer should accept or reject the quote on or before this date.
Salesperson: If you want a specific user from your organization to handle this sale to the customer, select the salesperson from the dropdown.
Project Name: If you’re creating this quote for an existing project, select the project from the dropdown. If you’d like to create a new project for the quote, click + Add New in the dropdown.
Select Price List: Choose a price list from the dropdown that you want to apply to this quote.
Item Table: Select and add the items and their quantities in the table. To apply price lists to individual items, select the price list from the Apply Price List dropdown under the Rate column in the table.
Note: This feature is not enabled by default, To enable it and learn more, refer to our help document on how to enable price lists.

Shipping Charges: Enter any applicable shipping charges.
Adjustment: Enter the adjustment amount here. Use a negative sign (-) to decrease the transaction amount.
Customer Notes: Add any necessary notes for the customer. If you’ve already added them in Quotes Preferences, they will appear here.
Terms and Conditions: Add any terms and conditions for the customer. If you’ve already added them in Quotes Preferences, they will appear here.
Create a retainer invoice for this quote automatically: Check this option to automatically generate a retainer invoice once the customer accepts the quote in the customer portal. Specify the percentage to collect as a retainer from the total amount and set up a payment gateway.
Click Save as Draft to save the quote in the Draft status, or Save and Send to save and send it to the customer via email.
Pro Tip: Set up the Customer Portal for the customer, if you haven’t already, to enable them to view, comment, accept, or reject the quote directly.

Now, once you’ve created the quote, you can send it to the customer or mark it as sent if you’ve already shared it through other means.

Note: If you save your quote as Draft, it will not be included in the reports. To include it in the reports, you need to either send it to your customer or mark it as sent.
