Convert to Invoice
Once the customer accepts the quote or you mark it as accepted and the work is complete, you can convert it to an invoice. Here’s how:

Go to Sales on the left sidebar, and select Quotes.
Select the quote you want to convert to an invoice.
In the Details page, click Convert and select Convert to Invoice in the dropdown.
You’ll now be redirected to the New Invoice page. Fill in the following fields:
Customer Name: Verify and update, if needed.
Invoice#: This will be auto-populated, but you can enter it manually if needed.
Invoice Date: Select the creation date of the invoice.
Review and update other necessary details.
Click Save as Draft to save it as a draft, or Save and Send to save and send it to the customer.
Now, after converting the quote into an invoice and saving it as a draft or sending it to the customer, the quote will be marked as Invoiced.
