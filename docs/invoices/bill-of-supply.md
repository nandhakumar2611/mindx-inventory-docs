What is a Bill of Supply?
A Bill of Supply is a document issued by GST Registered Businesses in place of a Tax Invoice. It is used by Composition Vendors and businesses dealing with Exempted Goods.

When is a Bill of Supply issued?
A bill of supply is usually issued when a business sells goods and services that are classified as exempt from GST. For example, a fruit vendor would not be issuing a regular Tax Invoice on sale but raise a Bill of Supply for his customers.

Also, in cases where a business is registered under the Composition scheme one should issue only a Bill of Supply and not Tax Invoices to their customers as they can not charge GST on their sales transactions.
