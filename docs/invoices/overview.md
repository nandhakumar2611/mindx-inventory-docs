Introduction - Invoices
An invoice is a financial document which indicates the supply of goods or services between a vendor and a customer.

How does an invoice work? The workflow of an invoice in Zoho Books is as follows:

Create an invoice.
Save it as a draft to be edited later (Save as Draft) or send it to your customer’s email address right away (Save & Send).
In case the invoice crosses its due date, its status changes to Overdue.
When you receive the payment from your customer, you can Record Payment for the invoice.
After recording payment, the invoice status changes to Paid, and this will reflect in various sales reports.
You can view all the payments recorded for your customers in the Payments Recorded module under Sales.
