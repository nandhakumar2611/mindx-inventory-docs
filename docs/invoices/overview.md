Introduction - Invoices
An invoice is a financial document that represents the supply of goods or services between a vendor and a customer within MindX Inventory.

How Does an Invoice Work?
The workflow of an invoice in MindX Inventory is as follows:

Create an Invoice: Initiate the invoicing process by entering the required details.
Save or Send: You can either save the invoice as a draft for later editing or send it directly to your customerâ€™s email.
Invoice Status: If the invoice exceeds its due date, its status will automatically update to "Overdue."
Record Payment: Upon receiving payment from your customer, you can record this payment against the invoice.
Update Status: After recording the payment, the invoice status changes to "Paid," reflecting this in various sales reports.
View Payments: All recorded payments for your customers can be viewed in the Payments Recorded module under Sales.
