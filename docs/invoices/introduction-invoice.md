# **Introduction - Invoices**

An invoice is a financial document that represents the supply of goods or services between a vendor and a customer within MindX Inventory.

## **How Does an Invoice Work?**

The workflow of an invoice in MindX Inventory is as follows:

- **Create an Invoice**: Initiate the invoicing process by entering the required details.

- **Save or Send**: You can either save the invoice as a draft for later editing or send it directly to your customer’s email.

- **Invoice Status**: If the invoice exceeds its due date, its status will automatically update to "Overdue."

- **Record Payment**: Upon receiving payment from your customer, you can record this payment against the invoice.

- **Update Status**: After recording the payment, the invoice status changes to "Paid," reflecting this in various sales reports.

- **View Payments**: All recorded payments for your customers can be viewed in the Payments Recorded module under Sales.
