Opening Balance for Customers and Vendors
You could be carrying over your customer or vendor balances when you migrate from another accounting application to Zoho Books. You can record those balances in Zoho Books in the following ways:

Import customers or vendors along with their opening balances in the Customers or Vendors module.

Import opening balances for Accounts Receivable from customers and Accounts Payable from vendors in the Opening Balances section.

Enter balances for new customers or vendors in the Other Details section of the customer or vendor Creation page.

Enter balances for existing customers in the Outstanding Receivables and for existing vendors in the Outstanding Payables section in the Overview page.

Insights:

Outstanding Receivables in the customer Overview page contains the total amount the customer owes you (for the invoices created) and also contains the opening balance you initially added for the customer.
Outstanding Payables in the vendor Overview page contains the total amount you owe your vendor (for the bills created) and also contains the opening balance you initially added for the vendor.
Outstanding Opening Balance is the amount the customer owes you or you owe a vendor, excluding the sales and purchase transactions recorded in Zoho Books. Each time you record a payment (other than the payments for invoices or bills), the outstanding opening balance decreases.
If you want to view or update the opening balance you had entered:

Navigate to Sales in the left sidebar and select Customers, or go to Purchases and select Vendors.
Select the customer/vendor for whom you want to view or update the opening balance.
Click View Opening Balance below the Receivables section.
